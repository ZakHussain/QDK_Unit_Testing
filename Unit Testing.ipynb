    "This tutorial introduces you to building blocks for unit testing in Q#. Diagnosing errors and understanding the expected outcome of your code is as true in quantum computing as it is in classical computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will see how the Q# language and built-in libraries allow you to build/use operations and functions to test your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this tutorial, I recommend you complete the following notebooks:  \n",
    "* [Introduction to the Qubit](../Qubit/Qubit.ipynb)\n",
    "* [Single Qubit Gates](../SingleQubitGates/SingleQubitGates.ipynb) \n",
    "* [Multiqubit Gystems](../MultiQubitSystems/MultiQubitSystems.ipynb)\n",
    "* [Multiqubit Gates](../MultiQubitGates/MultiQubitGates.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each topic, I will link you to additional readings found in the microsoft QDK docs. I will also state what you should take away from the assigned reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that you've completed the four tutorials above, you should understand how gates are used to manipulate qubit registers. With that, you can focus on navigating the Q# language to start writing unit tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Operations and functions \n",
    "* Using the diagnostics namespace \n",
    "* Raising errors using fail and facts\n",
    "* Dump Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the notebook, there are exercises in building unit tests. they will start relatively simple (given you understand the fundamentals of Q#) and gradually get more difficult. Spend at least 20 minutes on each problem before looking at the answers. \n",

    "Congratulations! Now that you have gone through this notebook on building unit tests, you should have a good idea of the tools available to you in Q# to build more complicated tests. Now, you are are neither a pro at building unit test, nor are you an amature, rather you are in a superposition of both states. Have fun explore Quantum! (:  "
